This is EXACTLY what I needed to convert a flatscreen TV with only optical out sound into a TV that would work with headphones. Only small issue is the volume for the headphone jack is fixed but for me it's as loud as I need it to be. If you're a little hard of hearing you might need a headphone amplifier.
My grandmother was forced to get a new DirectTV receiver after her's gave up the special smoke during a storm. This device let me go from optical audio to RCA so she could keep using her insanely priced headset with her TV so she could hear her shows. This device worked as expected and was very easy to install.
Works like a champ! Going from digital audio Pn back of tv to digital on on this hardwareto then to a 20 ft. Headphone jack. Works like a charm! I plugged the power cable ( USB on the other end) to a USB on the TV set so I wouldn't have to use a power brick or anything else! I use it to quietly (via head phones) listen to YouTube while still chromecasting it to my tv! Great product!
Worked great the first 2 times I used it. Then it quit passing any signal. Since this is used in our RV, the failure is more than annoying. Will return to Amazon for refund.
My first set of Bluetooth earbuds, seem to be well made, nice sound, would have given 5 stars but the left earbud is considerably louder than the right which is bothersome, comes with three silicone ear canal insert sizes, three ear hook sizes and a little storage bag. I just wished that the sound was equal in both buds.
Love these great sound.
Delivers what it promisses for a budget device. Does not fall from ears, has a great, sharp sound. The bass could be a bit better, but seems it's characteristic of such types of earphones. I recommend this product !!Delivers what it promisses for a budget device. Does not fall from ears, has a great, sharp sound.
